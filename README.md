# surveyProject

This project uses dplyr and ggplot2 to analyze survey data from Ernest et al., 2009.  It focuses on the weight data gathered from a large number of rodents collected over a 25-yr period, from 1977 to 2002, in the Chihuahuan Desert.

Figure 1 is a line graph which represents the average weight of captured rodents by month.  
Figure 2 is a boxplot which illustrates the distribution of weights of the different rodent genuses.
Figure 3 is a line chart which compares the weights of rodents found over time in the five different survey plot types..

The ANOVA test was done to determine if male and female rodents were equally surveyed.
